LAB 0: instroduction to c and git

This repository contains two small c code files that can be used to perform various arithmetic and logic operations on two different integer values with a char variable that determines the operations to be performed. For example in this code, if num1 and num2 both had the integer value of 3, and the char is a'/', then at the end of the code, the function will return the result of the operation on num1 and num2. In the case of this example, the function will return a 1.
